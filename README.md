# pnlAssignment

I spent a good amount of time setting up a linux emulator on my windows machine and some parts of the 
environment were still broken and cout produced a seg fault for a strange reason so I had to use printf instead.
If I was to finish the lifo logic I would use a stack instead to deal with the most recent trade and deal with pnl that way.


I ran this project with the following lines of code

cmake --build build

./build/myProject "csv file path" "logic"
